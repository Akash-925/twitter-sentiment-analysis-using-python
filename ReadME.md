## Sentiment Analysis using Twitter posts

Our main objective is to gather some textual data(mainly tweets) and parse it to infer some sentimental meaning from that data.

### Steps

 - The very first step is to create a twitter developer account and further create an application within that account.
 - Go to https://developer.twitter.com for creating a twitter developer account.
 - After successfully creating an app, copy the token keys from the keys section in app details.
 - These keys will authenticate the developer account in order to access the tweets which are to be analysed.
