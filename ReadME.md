# twitter-sentiment-analysis-using-python

Our main objective is to gather some textual data(mainly tweets) and parse it to infer some sentimental meaning from that data.

Steps:

1. The very first step is to create a twitter developer account and further create an application within that account.

2. Go to https://developer.twitter.com for creating a twitter developer account.

3. After successfully creating an app, copy the token keys from the keys section in app details.

4. These keys will authenticate the developer account in order to access the tweets which are to be analysed.
